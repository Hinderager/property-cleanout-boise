              <p>Tires don't decompose. Leave one in a landfill and it'll still be there in 500 years. That's why proper recycling matters. When you use Top Shelf Tire Removal, your old tires don't just disappear—they get turned into something useful.</p>
              <p>Here's how tire recycling actually works and why it's worth doing right.</p>

                  <p className="text-gray-600">Shredded tires burn hotter than coal and are used by cement kilns and power plants as an alternative fuel source. It's one of the most common uses for recycled tires.</p>

              <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-600">
                <p><strong>Environmental Protection:</strong> Illegally dumped tires collect water and become breeding grounds for mosquitoes. They're also fire hazards—tire fires are nearly impossible to put out and release toxic smoke.</p>
                <p><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> Idaho has strict rules about tire disposal. Dumping tires illegally can result in fines up to $5,000 plus cleanup costs.</p>
                <p><strong>Resource Conservation:</strong> Recycling one ton of tires saves about 1.5 tons of CO2 emissions compared to making new materials from scratch.</p>
                <p><strong>Community Health:</strong> Tire piles attract rodents and insects, pose fire risks, and are eyesores. Proper removal keeps neighborhoods safe and clean.</p>
