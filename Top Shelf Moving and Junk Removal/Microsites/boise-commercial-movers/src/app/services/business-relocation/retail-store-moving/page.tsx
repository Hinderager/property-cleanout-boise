            <h2>Moving a Store Is Complicated</h2>
            <p>
              Retail stores have a lot of moving parts—literally. You've got shelving, display fixtures,
              point-of-sale systems, back office equipment, and probably thousands of individual products.
              And you need it all moved fast because every day you're closed is lost revenue.
            </p>
            <p>
              We've moved clothing boutiques, sporting goods stores, furniture showrooms, hardware stores,
              and everything in between. We know how to pack inventory, disassemble fixtures, and get
              everything set up at the new location so you can open for business ASAP.
            </p>

            <h2>What We Move</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Display shelving and fixtures</li>
              <li>Clothing racks and mannequins</li>
              <li>Checkout counters and POS systems</li>
              <li>All retail inventory</li>
              <li>Storage and back office equipment</li>
              <li>Signage (interior and exterior)</li>
              <li>Display cases and merchandising units</li>
              <li>Security systems and cameras</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How We Handle Inventory</h2>
            <p>
              Inventory is the tricky part. Small items need to be packed carefully. Fragile stuff needs
              extra protection. And everything needs to be organized so you can find what you need when
              you're setting up the new store.
            </p>
            <p>
              We'll pack inventory by section or category—whatever makes sense for your store. We label
              everything clearly so you know exactly what's in each box. If you want to keep things on
              hangers or in their current containers, we can work with that too.
            </p>

            <h2>Fixtures and Displays</h2>
            <p>
              Retail fixtures can be bulky and awkward. Shelving units, gondolas, display racks—we'll
              disassemble what needs to come apart and move everything safely. At the new location, we'll
              reassemble and place fixtures according to your store layout.
            </p>

            <h2>Can You Help Set Up the New Store?</h2>
            <p>
              Absolutely. Many of our retail clients want help with the new store setup. We can install
              shelving, arrange displays, unpack inventory onto shelves, and get the whole store ready
              to open. Just let us know what level of setup you need.
            </p>

            <h2>Minimizing Store Closure Time</h2>
            <p>
              Most stores close Thursday night, we move Friday and Saturday, and they open Sunday or
              Monday at the new spot. Some larger stores might need an extra day, but we'll work as fast
              as possible to minimize your downtime.
            </p>
            <p>
              We can also do phased moves if you want to keep part of your operation running. Move the
              back office first, then the sales floor, or whatever sequence works for your business.
            </p>

            <h2>What About Clothing Stores?</h2>
            <p>
              Clothing stores have their own challenges—tons of inventory, lots of fixtures, and everything
              needs to stay organized. We'll keep clothes on hangers if that's easier, and we'll pack
              folded items carefully in boxes. Shoes, accessories, everything gets labeled and tracked.
            </p>

            <h2>Do You Move Large Furniture Showrooms?</h2>
            <p>
              Yes. Furniture stores are one of our specialties. We'll move display furniture, warehouse
              inventory, customer orders that are waiting for pickup—all of it. We know how to handle
              large furniture items and we've got the trucks and equipment to move lots of it efficiently.
            </p>
