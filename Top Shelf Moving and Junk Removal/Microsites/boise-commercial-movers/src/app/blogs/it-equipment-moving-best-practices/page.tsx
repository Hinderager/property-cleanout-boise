              Computer equipment looks sturdy. Metal cases, solid construction, heavy components. It seems like it should survive a move just fine. And then someone drops a server or doesn't secure a hard drive properly, and suddenly you're spending thousands on recovery services hoping to get your data back.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              IT equipment requires different handling than furniture. Static electricity can fry components. Improper shutdown procedures can corrupt data. Temperature changes can cause condensation damage. One mistake during an office move can cost more than the entire moving budget.

              Here's how to move IT equipment during your Boise office relocation without turning it into an expensive disaster. These practices come from businesses that learned the hard way and IT professionals who've seen every possible mistake.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              This is not negotiable. Before a single piece of IT equipment gets unplugged, back up everything that matters. Full backups of servers, copies of critical files, exports of databases. Everything.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              You're probably thinking "we already do regular backups." Great. Do another one right before the move and verify it's complete. Test that you can actually restore from those backups. Finding out your backup process doesn't work properly when you desperately need it is not the time you want that discovery.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              If you're using cloud services, confirm everything's synced. If you have local servers, back them up to external drives that travel separately from the servers themselves. Don't put all your eggs in one truck — if something happens during transport, you need recovery options.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Document what's backed up and where those backups are. Not just in your head — actual written documentation. If something goes wrong, stressed-out you needs a checklist, not vague memories of what might be backed up somewhere.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              Critical systems should have multiple backup copies stored in different locations. Paranoid? Maybe. But data recovery from failed moves costs thousands of dollars and weeks of downtime. Extra backups are cheap insurance.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Yanking power cables might work for desk lamps. It destroys servers and network equipment.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Servers need proper shutdown procedures. Operating systems have to close cleanly, databases need to finish writing data, services have to stop correctly. Just cutting power can corrupt file systems and damage data. If you don't know the correct shutdown procedure for your equipment, find someone who does before move day.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Document the shutdown sequence for complex setups. What gets turned off first? Which systems depend on others? What order do things need to start up in at the new location? Write this down clearly so anyone can follow the steps. Don't rely on someone's memory when you're moving critical infrastructure.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Disconnect network cables before power cables. Label everything as you disconnect it. Which cable goes where, what port connects to what device. IT equipment has lots of similar-looking cables. Without labels, you're guessing during setup at the new office.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              Take photos during disassembly. Your server rack, your networking closet, your cable management — photograph everything before you start disconnecting. Visual references beat written descriptions when you're trying to recreate complex setups.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gunmetal mb-6">Create a Labeling System That Actually Works</h2>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              You can't just write "computer" on every box and hope for the best. IT equipment moves require detailed labeling or you'll waste hours figuring out what goes where.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Label equipment with its purpose and location.</strong> Not just "server" — "File Server - goes in server room rack position 3." Not just "monitor" — "Monitor for reception desk PC." The more specific, the easier setup becomes.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Use color-coded labels for different departments.</strong> Blue for IT, red for accounting, green for sales. This helps movers put boxes in the right rooms and helps you prioritize what gets set up first.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Label both ends of every cable.</strong> Tape labels on each end showing what connects to what. "Server 1 power" on one end, "UPS outlet 3" on the other. This seems excessive until you're staring at a pile of identical black cables with no idea where they go.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Number boxes and create a master list.</strong> Box 1 contains X, box 2 contains Y. If something goes missing during the move, you know exactly what's lost. This also helps you track what's been unpacked and what still needs setup.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Keep cables with their devices.</strong> Tape power cables to equipment or bag them together. Don't throw all cables in one box and equipment in another. That's a nightmare to sort out later.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gunmetal mb-6">Protect Equipment During Transport</h2>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              IT equipment is more fragile than it looks. Hard drives have moving parts that don't like vibration. Circuit boards are sensitive to static electricity. Monitors crack if they're stacked wrong.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Use original packaging if you have it.</strong> Those foam inserts and specialized boxes exist for a reason. They're designed to protect expensive equipment during shipping. If you don't have original boxes, use heavy-duty boxes with proper padding.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Remove hard drives from servers if they're not secured.</strong> Some servers have hot-swappable drives that can shift during transport. Either secure them properly or remove them entirely and transport them separately with extra padding.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Don't stack heavy items on top of equipment.</strong> That desktop PC might support a monitor on top during normal use, but bouncing around in a truck with weight on top can crack cases and damage internal components.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Control temperature and humidity.</strong> If you're moving during extreme weather in Boise — hot summer days or freezing winter — let equipment acclimate before powering it on. Rapid temperature changes cause condensation, which causes short circuits.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Consider climate-controlled transport for servers.</strong> If you're moving sensitive equipment during temperature extremes, it's worth paying for climate-controlled trucks. Way cheaper than replacing fried hardware.

              Getting everything to the new location is only half the job. Now you need to make it all work again.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Start with infrastructure.</strong> Network equipment first, then servers, then end-user computers. You need the foundation working before you connect everything else. Trying to troubleshoot computer problems when your network isn't even running yet wastes time.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Follow startup procedures carefully.</strong> If you documented shutdown procedures, follow them in reverse. Don't just power everything on simultaneously and hope it works. Controlled startup prevents cascading failures when systems try to connect to services that aren't running yet.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Test connectivity before declaring success.</strong> Can computers access the internet? Can they print? Can users access shared drives and business systems? Test the actual workflows people need, not just whether lights are blinking.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Have someone knowledgeable present.</strong> Your IT person (or an IT contractor if you don't have dedicated staff) should oversee setup. Movers can position equipment, but technical setup requires technical knowledge. Budget for their time on move day.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Don't assume everything works perfectly.</strong> Plan time for troubleshooting. Something always needs adjustment — a configuration that needs updating with the new location, a cable that got mixed up, a service that didn't restart properly. Build buffer time into your schedule for fixing these issues.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Small offices with basic equipment can usually handle IT moves with careful planning. But some situations require professional help.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Server rooms and data centers.</strong> If you have rack-mounted servers, SAN storage, complex networking infrastructure — hire professionals. These systems cost tens of thousands of dollars. Proper handling requires specialized knowledge and equipment.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>High-value equipment.</strong> If replacing your IT infrastructure would cost more than a few thousand dollars, professional handling is worth the investment. The insurance coverage alone justifies the cost.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Zero downtime requirements.</strong> If your business absolutely cannot be offline — even for hours — you need IT moving specialists who can perform live migrations or rapid cutover procedures. This isn't DIY territory.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              Professional IT movers in Boise understand proper shutdown procedures, have appropriate packing materials, carry the right insurance, and know how to handle sensitive equipment. They cost more than general movers, but they prevent the expensive mistakes that general movers make with technical equipment.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              IT equipment moves require more planning and care than furniture moves. Backup everything before you start. Follow proper shutdown procedures. Label meticulously. Protect equipment during transport. Test everything after setup.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              For basic setups, careful planning and attention to detail are enough. For complex infrastructure or high-value equipment, hire professionals who specialize in IT moves. The cost of professional help is always less than the cost of replacing damaged equipment or recovering from data loss.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              Your business runs on technology. Treat IT equipment moves with the seriousness they deserve, and you'll avoid the disasters that happen when people treat servers like furniture.
