              Idaho is tough on HVAC systems. We get triple-digit summer heat that makes your AC work overtime. We get below-freezing winter nights that test your furnace. That swing from one extreme to another puts stress on equipment year after year.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Maintenance isn't glamorous. Nobody gets excited about scheduling a furnace tune-up. But systems that get regular care last longer, run more efficiently, and break down less often. That's less money out of your pocket and fewer emergency calls on the coldest night of the year.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Spring in Boise is unpredictable. Some years we're running heat in April. Other years we need AC by early May. Use this shoulder season to prep your cooling system before you actually need it.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Schedule AC maintenance.</strong> This is the best time—HVAC companies aren't slammed yet, and if there's a problem, you have time to fix it before heat waves hit. A spring tune-up typically includes cleaning coils, checking refrigerant, testing electrical connections, and verifying the system starts and runs properly.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Clear the outdoor unit.</strong> Over winter, debris accumulates around your condenser. Dead leaves, pine needles, maybe some trash that blew against the unit. Clear at least two feet of space around it for proper airflow.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Change your filter.</strong> If you didn't change it in March, do it now. A clean filter at the start of cooling season helps your system work efficiently from day one.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Test the system.</strong> Before you really need it, turn on the AC for a few minutes. Make sure cool air comes out, the system cycles normally, and nothing sounds wrong. Better to discover issues now than on a 95-degree afternoon.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gunmetal mb-6">Summer: Keep It Running</h2>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Boise summers mean your AC runs a lot. During heat waves, it might run almost constantly. Here's how to help it keep up:
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Check filters monthly.</strong> When the AC runs more, filters get dirty faster. A clogged filter makes your system work harder, uses more electricity, and can lead to freezing of the evaporator coil. Check monthly; change when needed.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Keep the outdoor unit clear.</strong> Vegetation grows fast in summer. Make sure plants, shrubs, and grass aren't encroaching on your condenser. Restricted airflow means reduced efficiency.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Watch for warning signs.</strong> The system running constantly, warm air from vents, strange noises, ice on refrigerant lines—these all indicate problems. Catch them early before a minor issue becomes a major breakdown.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Be realistic about temperature.</strong> Most AC systems are designed to cool about 20 degrees below outdoor temperature. When it's 105 outside, your house might only get to 85. That's not a malfunction—it's just physics. Running your system harder won't change that; it'll just stress the equipment.

              Fall is furnace time. Before you need heat, make sure your system is ready to provide it.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Schedule furnace maintenance.</strong> Same logic as spring AC maintenance—do it before the rush. A fall tune-up includes checking the heat exchanger for cracks (safety issue), cleaning burners, testing safety controls, and verifying the system fires and heats properly.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Install a fresh filter.</strong> Your filter probably worked hard all summer. Start heating season with a clean one.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Test your thermostat.</strong> Switch from cooling to heating mode. Make sure it responds properly. If you have a programmable thermostat, update your schedule for winter habits.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Check your vents.</strong> Walk through your house and make sure supply and return vents aren't blocked by furniture, rugs, or drapes. Blocked vents create uneven heating and strain the system.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Test smoke and CO detectors.</strong> Furnaces burn fuel. Carbon monoxide is a real risk. Make sure your detectors work and have fresh batteries.

              Idaho winters mean your furnace works hard. Here's how to help it—and what to watch for:
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-blue-100 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Change filters regularly.</strong> When heat runs constantly, filters load up faster. Check monthly, especially during cold snaps when the furnace barely shuts off.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-blue-100 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Keep vents clear.</strong> As you rearrange for holiday guests or bring in winter gear, make sure you're not blocking vents.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-blue-100 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Monitor for issues.</strong> Strange smells, unusual noises, short cycling, uneven heating—address these before they become emergencies. A furnace that struggles during mild cold weather will fail during the really cold nights.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-blue-100 leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Know your emergency plan.</strong> If heat fails when it's 10 degrees outside, what do you do? Have a backup plan—space heaters, a fireplace, a place to stay. And have an HVAC company's number ready. Emergency calls happen; being prepared makes them less stressful.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Idaho's climate demands a lot from HVAC equipment. Systems that get regular maintenance handle that demand better and last longer.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              You can do a lot yourself—filter changes, clearing debris, keeping vents open. But professional maintenance catches things you can't see: refrigerant levels, electrical connections, heat exchanger condition, safety controls.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              Think of it like oil changes for your car. Skip them and the car runs fine—until it doesn't. Regular maintenance isn't exciting, but it beats the alternative.
