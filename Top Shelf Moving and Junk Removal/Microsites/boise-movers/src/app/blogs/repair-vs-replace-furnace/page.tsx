              Your furnace stops working on a cold January night. The technician diagnoses a failed heat exchanger. Now you're facing a decision: spend $1,500 on the repair, or $6,000 on a new furnace. Which makes more sense?
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              This question doesn't have a one-size-fits-all answer. It depends on your furnace's age, condition, the specific repair needed, and what makes financial sense for your situation.

            </div>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Furnaces typically last 15-20 years with proper maintenance. Some go longer, some fail earlier. But age matters because older furnaces have more problems waiting to happen.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Under 10 years old:</strong> Generally worth repairing unless the repair costs more than 50% of a new furnace. You've got years of life left.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>10-15 years old:</strong> The gray zone. Major repairs deserve serious consideration. Minor repairs are usually still worthwhile.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Over 15 years old:</strong> Replacement starts making more sense, especially for expensive repairs. Even if this repair works, another failure is probably coming soon.

          <div className="max-w-3xl mx-auto">
            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gunmetal mb-6">The 50% Rule</h2>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Here's a common guideline: if the repair costs more than 50% of a new furnace, replacement usually makes more sense. For a $5,000 replacement, that means repairs over $2,500 warrant a new system.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Why 50%? Because an expensive repair on an aging system is a gamble. You might get five more years. You might get five more months. That's money you won't get back when the next component fails.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              This rule isn't absolute. A three-year-old furnace with an unusual failure might justify a pricey repair because you're getting essentially new equipment back. Context matters.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              Some techs use an even simpler formula: if (repair cost × furnace age) exceeds $5,000, replace it. A $500 repair on a 12-year-old furnace? That's $6,000—probably time to consider replacement.

          <div className="max-w-3xl mx-auto">
            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gunmetal mb-6">What the Specific Repair Tells You</h2>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Not all furnace repairs are equal. Some are routine maintenance. Others signal deeper problems.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Minor repairs</strong> like ignitors, flame sensors, blower motors, and thermostats are generally worth fixing regardless of age. These parts wear out and are relatively inexpensive to replace.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Heat exchanger failures</strong> are different. Heat exchangers are expensive to replace, and a cracked exchanger can be dangerous (carbon monoxide risk). On furnaces over 15 years old, a failed heat exchanger usually means it's time to replace.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Control board failures</strong> on older furnaces can be problematic because parts availability becomes an issue. If the board for your 18-year-old furnace is discontinued, replacement might be your only option.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Repeated failures</strong> of different components suggest the system is generally wearing out. One repair leads to another. At that point, you're just prolonging the inevitable.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>

      {/* Efficiency Section */}
      <section className="py-12 md:py-16 bg-white">
        <div className="container mx-auto px-4">
          <div className="max-w-3xl mx-auto">
            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gunmetal mb-6">The Efficiency Angle</h2>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Older furnaces are less efficient than modern equipment. A 20-year-old furnace might be 80% efficient (or less), meaning 20% of your heating dollars go up the flue. New furnaces hit 95-98% efficiency.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Does that efficiency gain pay for a new furnace? Sometimes. It depends on your heating costs and how long you plan to stay in your home. For a Boise home spending $1,500/year on heating, a 15% efficiency improvement saves roughly $225/year.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              That's real money, but it takes years to pay back a $5,000 furnace investment through efficiency savings alone. The math works better if you were already facing a major repair.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              Efficiency shouldn't be the only reason to replace, but it's a nice bonus when replacement already makes sense for other reasons.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              There's no magic formula, but here's a simple decision tree: If your furnace is under 10 and the repair is reasonable, fix it. If it's over 15 and the repair is expensive, replace it. Everything in between requires judgment based on your specific situation.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              A good HVAC company will give you honest advice, not push you toward whatever makes them more money. If a tech tells you a repair is worth doing on an older unit, they're probably right. If they say it's time to replace, ask them to explain why.
