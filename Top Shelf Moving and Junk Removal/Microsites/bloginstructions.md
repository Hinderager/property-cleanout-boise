# Blog Post Creation Instructions

**Reference examples:**
- `boise-junk-removal/src/app/blogs/junk-removal-pricing-explained/page.tsx` (text-heavy, SEO-focused)
- `boise-junk-removal/src/app/blogs/why-your-stuff-is-ruining-your-life/page.tsx` (more visual)

## Writing Style

### Voice
- Conversational and direct — talk to the reader like a smart friend
- Second person ("you") throughout
- Confident but not preachy
- Self-aware about being a business (builds trust)

### Sentences
- Short paragraphs: 1-3 sentences max
- Mix punchy one-liners with medium sentences
- Use contractions naturally (you're, it's, don't)
- Ask occasional rhetorical questions

### Avoid
- Corporate jargon (leverage, optimize, solutions)
- Hype words (amazing, incredible, game-changer)
- "In today's fast-paced world" and similar filler
- Starting with "Are you struggling with..." or "Have you ever..."
- Generic advice everyone's heard before

### Structure
- Open with a specific, relatable observation (not a question)
- End with a simple takeaway
- CTAs should be casual, low-pressure

## SEO Requirements

### Keywords
- Include primary keyword in: title, meta description, H1, first paragraph, at least 2 H2s
- Use location keywords naturally: "Boise", "Treasure Valley", "Meridian", "Nampa"
- Include long-tail variations: "junk removal cost in Boise", "how much does X cost"
- Don't keyword stuff — read it out loud, if it sounds forced, rewrite it

### Content Depth
- Aim for 800-1200 words of actual text content
- Answer the questions people actually search for
- Include specific details (price ranges, timeframes, what's included)
- Cover related subtopics that support the main keyword

## Visual Design (Keep It Simple)

### Alternating Backgrounds
Cycle through these to create visual rhythm without overdoing it:
- `bg-white` — standard sections
- `bg-gradient-to-br from-slate-50 to-blue-50` — subtle emphasis
- `bg-gray-50` — light variety
- `bg-dark-blue text-white` — one dark section per post for contrast

**Never have two sections with the same background in a row.**

### Minimal Visual Elements
Use **1-2 visual elements per post**, not more. Choose from:
- One icon header (icon in colored circle next to H2)
- One checkmark list in the dark section
- Bold text for key points within paragraphs

**Don't use:** card grids, quote blocks, comparison grids, flow diagrams, stacked colored cards — unless the content specifically calls for it. Text is the priority.

## Post Structure

1. **Hero** — Title, subtitle, back link
2. **Intro** (white) — Set up the topic, 2-3 paragraphs
3. **Main content sections** (alternating backgrounds) — 3-5 sections of substantive text
4. **Your service** (dark-blue) — Brief explanation of how you help, optional checkmark list
5. **Bottom line** (white) — Summary and takeaway
6. **CTA** (gradient) — Low-pressure call to action
7. **Related Posts** (gray-50) — Link back to /blogs
