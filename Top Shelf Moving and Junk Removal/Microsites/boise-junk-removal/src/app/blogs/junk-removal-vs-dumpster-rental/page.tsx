              You've got a bunch of stuff that needs to go. Maybe it's a garage cleanout, a renovation project, or clearing out a family member's house. The question is: do you rent a dumpster and handle it yourself, or hire a junk removal service to take care of everything?

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Both options exist for good reason. They solve different problems and work better in different situations. The right choice depends on your project, your timeline, your physical ability, and honestly, how much you value your weekends.

              <strong>Dumpster rental</strong> means a company drops off a container at your property — usually for a few days to a week. You fill it yourself, then they come pick it up and haul it away. You pay for the rental period plus disposal fees, sometimes with weight limits.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Junk removal service</strong> means a crew shows up with a truck, loads your stuff for you, and takes it away the same day. You point at what goes, they do the heavy lifting. You pay based on how much truck space your stuff fills.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              The fundamental difference: dumpster rental is DIY with a bigger container. Junk removal is full service — they handle everything.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Dumpster rental works well for certain types of projects in the Boise area. Here's when it's actually the better choice:
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Renovation or construction projects.</strong> If you're doing a kitchen remodel or tearing out flooring, debris accumulates over several days. Having a dumpster on-site lets you toss materials as you work instead of making piles that get in the way. Contractors use dumpsters for exactly this reason.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Projects spread over time.</strong> Maybe you're cleaning out the garage on Saturday, the basement the following weekend, and the attic the weekend after that. A dumpster sitting in your driveway for two weeks lets you work at your own pace without scheduling multiple pickups.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>You're physically capable and don't mind the work.</strong> Some people genuinely prefer doing things themselves. If you're able-bodied, have time, and don't mind the labor, handling it yourself saves money — assuming you value your time at zero.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Very large volumes of debris.</strong> For massive cleanouts or demolition projects, multiple dumpster loads might be more economical than multiple junk removal trips. This is especially true for heavy materials like concrete or dirt that junk removal companies may not take or may charge extra for.

      {/* Dumpster Drawbacks - Gray Section */}
      <section className="py-12 md:py-16 bg-gray-50">

          <div className="max-w-3xl mx-auto">
            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gunmetal mb-6">The Downsides of Dumpster Rental</h2>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              But dumpster rental isn't all upside. There are real drawbacks to consider:
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>You do all the work.</strong> That old couch doesn't walk itself to the dumpster. Neither does the broken treadmill, the filing cabinet, or the boxes of who-knows-what in the basement. If you're clearing out a full garage, you're looking at hours of heavy lifting.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Permit requirements in Boise.</strong> If the dumpster can't fit in your driveway and needs to go on the street, you might need a permit from the city. This adds cost, paperwork, and time to the process. Not every neighborhood allows street placement at all.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Hidden costs add up.</strong> The base rental price often doesn't include delivery fees, pickup fees, overage charges if you exceed weight limits, or extended rental fees if you need more time. What looked like $300 can become $500 pretty easily.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Size guessing game.</strong> Order too small, you run out of space. Order too big, you're paying for capacity you don't use. Most people have no idea how much space their junk actually takes up until they start loading.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Restrictions on what goes in.</strong> Dumpster companies have long lists of prohibited items: mattresses, appliances, electronics, paint, chemicals, tires. You might fill the dumpster only to realize half your stuff can't actually go in it.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gunmetal mb-6">When Junk Removal Service Is the Better Choice</h2>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Junk removal service makes more sense in a lot of common situations:
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>You want it done today.</strong> Most junk removal companies in Boise, including us, offer same-day service. Call in the morning, junk is gone by afternoon. No waiting for dumpster delivery, no week of filling it, no waiting for pickup.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Heavy or awkward items.</strong> That hot tub, piano, or cast iron bathtub isn't something you can wrestle into a dumpster alone. Junk removal crews handle heavy lifting as part of the job. No injury risk, no asking friends for favors they'll resent.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Limited mobility or health concerns.</strong> Not everyone can spend a day hauling furniture. If physical limitations are a factor, junk removal is the obvious choice. The crew handles everything — you just point.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>No room for a dumpster.</strong> Some Boise properties don't have driveway space for a dumpster, or HOA rules prohibit them. Junk removal trucks come, load, and leave — no container sitting on your property for a week.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Mixed items including restricted stuff.</strong> We can take mattresses, appliances, electronics — items that dumpster companies won't allow. We know how to dispose of each item type properly, so you don't have to figure it out.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Let's talk real numbers for the Treasure Valley area.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Dumpster rental</strong> typically runs $300-600 for a 10-20 yard container for 5-7 days. Add delivery ($50-100), pickup, potential overage fees, and your total is often $400-700. Plus your time doing the actual loading.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Junk removal service</strong> for a similar volume (half to full truck) typically costs $250-600. That includes labor, hauling, and disposal. No surprises, no extra fees, no weekend spent sweating in the garage.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              For smaller jobs — a few pieces of furniture, a garage corner — junk removal is often cheaper than dumpster rental. The break-even point where dumpster rental becomes more economical is usually very large volumes or multi-week projects.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              What you're really paying for with junk removal is labor and convenience. If your time and energy have value (they do), factor that into your comparison.

      {/* Our Take - Dark Blue Section */}
      <section className="py-12 md:py-16 bg-dark-blue text-white">

          <div className="max-w-3xl mx-auto">
            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Our Honest Take</h2>

            <p className="text-lg text-blue-100 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              We're a junk removal company, so obviously we think junk removal is great. But we're not going to tell you it's always the right choice.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-blue-100 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              If you're a contractor with ongoing debris, rent a dumpster. If you enjoy physical labor and have flexible time, maybe a dumpster makes sense. If you're doing a multi-week cleanout at your own pace, a dumpster gives you that flexibility.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-blue-100 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              But for most one-time cleanouts — the garage that's gotten out of control, the estate that needs clearing, the furniture that needs to go — junk removal is faster, often similarly priced, and doesn't require you to spend your weekend hauling stuff.

              Ask yourself: Do I have time? Do I want to do heavy lifting? Do I need this done now or over several weeks? Do I have space for a dumpster? Can a dumpster even accept the items I have?
